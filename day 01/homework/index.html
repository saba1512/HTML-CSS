    <h1>infotmation about forest</h1>
    <h2>There are three types of forests: boreal, temperate, and tropical.
         On a global scale, forests are shaped by the amount of solar radiation and precipitation, both of which are influenced by latitude.
    </h2>
    <h3>first we have boreal forest.</h3>

        <p>The boreal forest, also known as taiga, is the world's largest land biome,
             characterized by coniferous forests and significant ecological importance.
           [taiga], also known as boreal forest or snow forest,
            is a biome characterized by coniferous forests consisting mostly of pines, spruces, and larches.
             The taiga, or boreal forest, is the world's largest land biome.
             [1] In North America, it covers most of inland Canada, Alaska, and parts of the northern contiguous United States.
             [2] In Eurasia, it covers most of Sweden, Finland, much of Russia from Karelia in the west to the Pacific Ocean (including much of Siberia),
              much of Norway and Estonia, some of the Scottish Highlands,[citation needed] some lowland/coastal areas of Iceland,
               and areas of northern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, and northern Japan (on the island of Hokkaido).</p>
               <h3>secend forest is temperate forest.</h3>
               <img src="temperate.jpg" width="500px" alt="">
               <p>A temperate forest is a forest found between the tropical and boreal regions, located in the temperate zone.
                 It is the second largest terrestrial biome, covering 25%[1] of the world's forest area,
                  only behind the boreal forest, which covers about 33%.
                   These forests cover both hemispheres at latitudes ranging from 25 to 50 degrees,
                   [2] wrapping the planet in a belt similar to that of the boreal forest.
                    Due to its large size spanning several continents, there are several main types: deciduous,
                     coniferous, mixed forest, and rainforest.</p>
                        <h3>third forest is tropical forest.</h3>
                        <img src="tropical.webp" width="500px" alt="">
                        <p>Tropical forests are forested ecoregions with tropical climates that is,
                             land areas approximately bounded by the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn,
                              but possibly affected by other factors such as prevailing winds.
                              Some tropical forest types are difficult to categorize.
                               While forests in temperate areas are readily categorized on the basis of tree canopy density
                               , such schemes do not work well in tropical forests.[1] There is no single scheme that defines what a forest is,
                                in tropical regions or elsewhere.[2] Because of these difficulties,
                                 information on the extent of tropical forests varies between sources.
                                  However, tropical forests are extensive, making up just under half the world's forests.
                                  [3] The tropical domain has the largest proportion of the world's forests (45 percent), followed by the boreal,
                                   temperate and subtropical domains.[4]    
                                    More than 3.6 million hectares of virgin tropical forest was lost in 2018.</p>
