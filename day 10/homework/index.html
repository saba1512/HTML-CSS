        <h2>What is the difference between block and inline?</h2>
        <p>Block elements take up the full width available, starting on a new line, while inline elements only take up
            as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.</p>
    </div class="card">
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Why width and height don't work on inline elements?</h2>
        <p>Width and height properties do not work on inline elements because they are designed to flow within the text
            and
            adjust their size based on the content. Inline elements do not create a new block-level box, so they cannot
            have
            explicit width and height settings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>What does inline-block do differently?</h2>
        <p>Inline-block elements combine characteristics of both block and inline elements. They allow you to set width
            and
            height like block elements, but they flow within the text like inline elements. This means they can sit next
            to
            other inline or inline-block elements without starting on a new line.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>What happens when an element has display: none?</h2>
        <p>When an element has display: none, it is completely removed from the document flow and does not take up any
            space
            on the page. It is as if the element does not exist in the HTML structure, and it will not be visible to
            users
            or affect the layout of other elements.</p>
